Play correspondence chess against Claude AI through email. Make moves at your own pace.

**Designed for use with a physical chess board** - emails contain move history in algebraic notation, perfect for following along on a real board.

## Features

- **Fully Email-Driven**: Play chess without leaving your inbox
- **Play Anytime**: No daily reminders - move when you want
- **Three Difficulty Levels**: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced
- **Standard Notation**: Uses algebraic notation (e.g., e4, Nf3, O-O)
- **Automatic Responses**: Claude responds within minutes of your move
- **Gmail Organization**: Labels threads as "chess-claude" for easy filtering

## How it works
- Set up the Google spreadsheet and app
- You are emailed Claude's move (or you move first if playing white)
- You reply with your move in algebraic notation
- The script polls Gmail every few minutes, picks up your reply, and emails back Claude's response in the same thread
- Game state lives in a Google Sheet that can be used to discuss your game with any AI chatbot
- All chess emails are labeled "chess-claude" for easy filtering


## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Google account with Gmail and Google Sheets
- Anthropic API key ([get one here](https://console.anthropic.com))

### Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Create a Google Sheet**
   - Open [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com)
   - Create a new blank spreadsheet

2. **Open Apps Script**
   - Go to `Extensions → Apps Script`
   - Delete any default code

3. **Add the Script**
   - Copy all code from `code.gs`
   - Paste into Apps Script editor
   - Save (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)

4. **Configure API Key**
   - Click `Project Settings` (gear icon)
   - Scroll to `Script Properties`
   - Add property: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` = your API key
   - (Optional) Add property: `EMAIL` = your email address

5. **Start Playing**
   - Run `quickStart()` function
   - Authorize when prompted
   - Check your email for the first game!

## How to Play

### Making Moves
Reply to the email thread with your move as the **first word**:
- `e4` - Pawn to e4
- `Nf3` - Knight to f3
- `O-O` - Castle kingside
- `Qxd7+` - Queen takes d7, check

### Commands
Type these as the **first word** in your reply:
- `NEW` - Start a new game
- `RESIGN` - Resign current game
- `PAUSE` - Pause the game
- `CONTINUE` - Resume after pause

### Algebraic Notation Quick Reference
```
Pieces:  K=King Q=Queen R=Rook B=Bishop N=Knight (pawns have no letter)
Moves:   Nf3 = knight to f3
Capture: Nxe5 = knight captures on e5
Castle:  O-O = kingside, O-O-O = queenside
Promote: e8=Q = pawn promotes to queen
Check:   + (e.g. Qd7+)
Mate:    # (e.g. Qf7#)
```

## Configuration Options

Edit these in the script's `CONFIG` object:

| Setting | Default | Options | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `DIFFICULTY` | `intermediate` | `beginner`, `intermediate`, `advanced` | Claude's playing strength |
| `PLAYER_COLOUR` | `white` | `white`, `black` | Your color for new games |
| `POLL_MINUTES` | `5` | Any number | How often to check for replies |

## Manual Setup Functions

Instead of `quickStart()`, you can run these individually:

1. `initialiseSheet()` - Set up the game state sheet
2. `setupTriggers()` - Configure email polling
3. `startFirstGame()` - Begin your first game

## Troubleshooting

### Game Not Responding?
- Check that triggers are set up (run `setupTriggers()`)
- Verify your move is the first word in your reply
- Ensure you're replying to the correct thread

### API Errors?
- Verify your API key in Script Properties
- Check your API usage at console.anthropic.com
- API calls are limited to 200/day by default

### Email Issues?
- Check spam/promotions folders
- Look for threads labeled "chess-claude"
- Ensure you're using the account that owns the script

### Reset Everything?
Run these in order:
1. Delete all triggers: `ScriptApp.getProjectTriggers().forEach(t => ScriptApp.deleteTrigger(t))`
2. Run `quickStart()` again
